# Class 19 Guide

The "Lecture Main Topics" section for each day can be used as a possible outline for a lecture. They're flows that have worked before, but feel free to deviate and do your own thing as fits your class.

## Overview of Today

Today's lecture will teach how to deal with post/get requests and Database.


## Code Examples

note put the demo here

## How do I prep for today?

- Prepare for code review. If you're nervous, find someone's code before lecture, and you can read it (and know what you'll talk about) before lecture begins.
- (put here how many demos and the names of them) the discussion of how to initialize a new project using the steps above.
- Prepare a demo of testing.
- make sure that the backed is fine with your DB

## Lecture Main Topics

How to store data coming from front-end in DB
- show them how do post request

Retrieve data from DB and show them.
- how to get data using Get request
- map the data using map() method

able to delete/update from DB (choose one of them to explain and leave the other for the lab).


Deployment on netlify
   - run npm build 
   - you can use either drag and drop the build folder or CLI with Netlify


Debugging

- Basics of how to deal with errors, try to make one and show them how to debug it.

## What might students struggle with today?

Students are going to have a hard time with the amount of new material. Some will continue to discover later.

### Code Review Notes

Some basic code review questions:

Does it work?
What part of this is confusing?
What could make it more readable?
What could have more explanation?
What could be broken into smaller pieces?
What would make this easier for others to understand.
How could this be more performant?
Are there 'red flags' (Experience: Things you don't do often. Why did they do that?)
Are 'bad inputs' accounted for?
Are there missing test cases?
Is it documented?

I found the best code reviews consisted of the students describing their code to each other, explaining why they choose those methods, and even helping teach the subjects of the labs.
