# Travel Destination

## **Lab 17**

### **Overview**

You will continue building on what you achieved in the last lab.

### **Requirements**

- You have to create two new components.
    - Tour
    - TourDetail


- Update Tours component:

    - Instead of returning a `<div>` each time. you must return and render a `<Tour/>`.
    - After that, you have to pass the data as props to the `<Tour/>`.and don’t forget to add the id as a key.


- Tour component:

    - In the tour component you have to display the same data that you have displayed before which are [ image, name ].

- Routing:
   - your will have two routes as the following: 
      1. To navigate back to the home page, path="/"
      2. in order to show more details about the city, path=`”/city/:id”`
  - Update your `<Header/>` to be containing a link that navigates to home.
  
         

- Tour Details:
    - Once the user clicks on any of the cities cards that you created, it should show details about that city.
       
    - Hint: 
        - You may use the filter method for Tour Details.
        - You may use Link from react-route-dom.
